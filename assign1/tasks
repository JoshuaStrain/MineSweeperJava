positive test:  nominal function, valid data/actions
negative test:  not nominal, invalid data/actions that the code handles w/out throwing exception
exception test: invalid condition that forces an exception

LISTS of Tests: new baseline

---------------------

J - expose a cell
T - expose an already exposed cell
J - row out of bounds in call to exposeCell
T - column out of bound in call to exposeCell

Too down in the weeds for first tests??

- generate random coordinate (x,y) outside of valid range [0,9] for each value
- test placing a mine.
- is the mine there?
- test did anyone win of the start of the game?
- test when exposed cell count = 90 did we win?
- does exposing a mine trigger a lose?
- does exposing empty trigger exposer of neighbors?
- adjacent calculated correctly?
- click on exposed cell does nothing happen? ignore or trigger an exceptions?
- does right clicking seal the cell? (state of the cell changes)
- does right clicking sealed cell unseal cell? ( state of cell changes?)
- all are 10 mines on the game board?
- Make sure we didn't generate the same cooridinates, 10 unique cooridnates.
- does getNeighbors find all the neighbors next to the newly exposed cell.
- test if the number of sealed that can be placed is correct.
